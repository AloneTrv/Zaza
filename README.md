# Fluxus Key Bypasser
Bypasser for Fluxus' key system

# ‼ This is the original repository & bypass, any other repo is simply copying off my bypass without credit. ‼

## Requirements
 - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## To get it to work
 - Open the start url and complete the captcha, once it redirects you to the first linkvertise close the tab and run the program. Should work.
  - Note: I am hopefully making a better workaround for this, expect an update soon.

## How to run (WINDOWS)
- Download or clone this repo
- Run `install.bat` and and wait until it finishes installation
- Run `start.bat`
- Ok thats it

## How to run (others)
- Download or clone this repo
- Run `npm install` in console and and wait until it finishes installation
- Run `node index.js HWIDHERE` in console
- Ok thats it

## How to get HWID
- Whenever you press "Get Key" in Fluxus it opens this tab --> flux.li/windows/start.php?HWID=XXXX, copy all of XX until the end of the url


## TODO
- Add HWID saver. Suggestion from issue [#2](https://github.com/MEMEZNUT999/fluxus-key-bypasser/issues/2)
- Auto-Updater
